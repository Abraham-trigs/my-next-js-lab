# 📘 My Next.js Lab

Welcome to **My Next.js Lab** — a personal sandbox where I build, break, and master **Next.js** through hands-on projects, experiments, and tutorials.

This repository chronicles my **Next.js Learning Journey**, from the basics to advanced app features like server-side rendering, routing, state management, and full-stack development.
